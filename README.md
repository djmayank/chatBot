# chatBot

A chatBot for Messenger (Facebook messenger)

It will repeat the lines we text in chat and we can have a special keyword that will display the cards.

The cards are nothing but the piece of information with images which can be jpg png or animated gifs.

These cards can have two types of links 

One is the postcard that will reply for the types of questions or information user might be interested in.

Next is the link or the external link that will link you to the other sites or any link (image ,amazon,flipkart anything).

A simple implementation is done by using javascript and node.js.
